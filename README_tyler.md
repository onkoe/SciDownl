## Installation and Usage

Please ensure you're in a WSL (or normal Linux) terminal for the following steps:

1. Paste this into your terminal to install `uv`: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
1. Use this to install `pypy`, a faster Python interpreter: `uv python install pypy`
1. Run the project with: `uvx scidownl`

As you can see, `uvx` runs the project for you, making it so you don't need to worry about the virtual environment. This will avoid `pip` and prevent your WSL from dying again lol
